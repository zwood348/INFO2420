<h1>Extreme Honeymoons Tributes</h1>

<h2>Brian and Kitty</h2>

<p>I'm Brian Jones.</p>
<p>My wife Kitty and I were just married last winter.</p>
<p>We wanted a memorable honeymoon experience, and so we looked into the excursions offered by Extreme Honeymoons.</p>
<p>Something I always wanted to do was bow hunt.</p>
<p>We were surprised that a cougar hunt was available the week just after we were to be married.</p>
<p>It was great to have all the details of this trip taken care of for us by professionals who knew just what was needed.</p>
<p>The owners even provided some archery instruction for both of us before the trip began.</p>
<p>We met our hunt leader, Tom Henry, the first day of our trip. He runs a team of 4 hound dogs when he hunts cougars. The hunt began just after a light snow, so the big cats could be tracked.</p>
<p>We saw three cougars that day, but were not able to get any clean shots. It was a tiring, exciting, beautiful weekend. Thanks so much, Extreme Honeymoons, for a memorable honeymoon experience.</p>
<p>We are sending a couple of snapshots of our great weekend.</p>
<p>Thanks for the memories,</p>
<p>Brian and Kitty Jones</p>

<h2>David and Mary</h2>

<p>We just wanted to thank you folks at Extreme Honeymoons for a rip-roaring time during our honeymoon trip.</p>
<p>I had always wanted to try heliskiing, and my honeymoon seemed as good a time to go for it.</p>
<p>Both my wife Mary and I are experienced downhill skiers, but we had never tried extreme skiing or snowboarding before.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to be able to rely on your expert team of pilots and guides to make this dream come true.</p>
<p>We were lucky to have new powder snow the weekend we had booked the trip.</p>
<p>Extreme Honeymoons even captured these great photos of our trip.</p>
<p>Kings Peak is the tallest peak in the state of Utah, and it was really amazing that we can now say that we skied it.</p>
<p>We were able to make 6 runs a day and each one was an adventure.</p>
<p>I was worried about our ski and snowboarding equipment, but it was double checked by our guide and we had no problems.</p>
<p>We will tell all our friends about this great way to spend a honeymoon.</p>
<p>Thanks for handling the details, so we could enjoy this experience together.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>David and Mary Farnsworth</p>

<h2>Peter and Polly</h2>

<p>Who would have thought you could spend your honeymoon having the adventure of your life.</p>
<p>I wanted to give my new wife, Louise, an exciting honeymoon. I have been riding mountain bikes for about 5 years.</p>
<p>Both Louise and I are in fairly good shape, so the mountain biking trip over the red rock of Moab was the trip we wanted for ourselves.</p>
<p>The bed and breakfast inn we stayed in down in Moab was great. We had an early breakfast and then were transferred along with our equipment and a light lunch to the trail head.</p>
<p>We were provided with a map and GPS receiver and we were off.</p>
<p>The day was hot, about 90 degrees, but we had plenty of water and we never felt stressed.</p>
<p>Every time we look at our photos from that weekend, we remember the wonderful time we had.</p>
<p>The cost was sure reasonable and we could have never done this without your help.</p>
<p>Thanks for the time of our lives,</p>
<p>Peter and Polly Renquist</p>
