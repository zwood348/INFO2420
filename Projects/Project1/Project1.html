        <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
        <li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</li>
        <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</li>

    <h2>Jami Lin Website Critique</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>My first impression of the site is it feels like I'm walking into a scam. The banner at the top is low res and the website feels like it wasn't put together correctly.</li>
        <li>The flow of information is completely off. There is a list of links to other sites in the middle, and the navigation for the site itself is at the bottom of the page. It's confusing and seems unprofessional.</li>
        <li>The structure is confusing. The links to other sites are the main focus of the page, and the navigation for the site itself is at the bottom. It makes it hard to find what you're looking for.</li>
        <li>As a whole, I would say the graphics add to the site. If the site was just a wall of text, I think it would be impossible to use. The banner is the only graphic I would say detracts from the site. It needs to be replaced with something higher resolution.</li>
        <li>The loading time of the page was excellent. It loaded nearly instantly.</li>
        <li>The text color and size are pretty readable. The text could be a bit larger, but it's not a major issue. There is no overall background color or image.</li>
        <li>Site navigation consists of links to other sites located at the bottom of the page. The bar itself seems professionally made, but its placement seems incorrect.</li>
        <li>The color scheme was consistent with some of the sites listed in the navigation. The sites are obviously supposed to be related, but some of them had wildly different schemes.</li>
        <li>The site responds well to smaller window sizes. The images and text resize appropriately.</li>
        <li>Most of the individual elements of the site are well done. They're structured well and look professionally made. The ordering of the elements is strange. It puts the contacts usually reserved for the bottom of a page front and center, and looks like it was put together blindfolded.</li>
