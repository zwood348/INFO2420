<h2>Some Butterfly Favorites</h2>

<h3>Monarchs</h3>

<a href="Monarch.html"><img src="Images/Thumbnails/MonarchSm.jpg" alt="Monarch Butterfly" class="thumbnailleft" width="100" height="71"></a>

<p>
	The Monarch butterfly, also known as the milkweed butterfly, 
	is not able to survive cold winters of North America. 
	Eastern Monarchs will migrate to Mexico and those in the 
	Rocky Mountains will travel to California.  The longest 
	distance Monarch butterflies have been known to journey 
	is from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, a distance 
	of about 2,000 miles, and return to the north again in the spring. 
</p>

<a href="Chrysalis.html"><img src="Images/Thumbnails/ChrysalisSm.jpg" alt="Picture of a chrysalis" class="thumbnailright" width="100" height="71"></a>

<p>
	The Monarch cocoon is called a chrysalis.  As the butterfly 
	begins to metamorphose, the chrysalis begins to darken and 
	will turn transparent just before the butterfly emerges.  
	The mature butterfly emerges after about two weeks and hangs 
	from the split chrysalis for several hours until its wings 
	are dry. Monarchs can live two to eight weeks in a butterfly 
	garden.

<h3>Swallowtails</h3>

<a href="TigerSwallowtail.html"><img src="Images/Thumbnails/TigerSm.jpg" alt="Tiger Butterfly" class="thumbnailleft" width="100" height="71"></a>

<p>
	Swallowtail butterflies, being large, colorful, and attractive, 
	have been the target of butterfly collectors in earlier times. 
	The adults are often tailed like the forked tail of some swallows, 
	giving the insect its name.  There are at least 550 species, 
	and though the majority are tropical, members of the family 
	are found on all continents except Antarctica.  
</p>

<a href="ZebraSwallowtail.html"><img src="Images/Thumbnails/ZebraSm.jpg" alt="Zebra Swallowtail Butterfly" class="thumbnailright" width="100" height="71"></a>

<p>
	The Zebra Swallowtail has triangular wings with long tails. 
	It has some distinctive black and white markings on its wings 
	and some small red and blue markings on both bottom corners 
	of the wings.  The Zebra Swallowtail Butterfly is also the 
	official state butterfly of Tennessee.

<h3>Blue Morpho</h3>

<a href="BlueMorpho.html"><img src="Images/Thumbnails/MorphoSm.jpg" alt="Morpho Butterfly" class="thumbnailleft" width="100" height="71"></a>

<p>
	Many Morpho butterflies are colored in metallic, shimmering 
	shades of blue and green. These colors are not a result of 
	pigmentation but are an example of iridescence, the sun 
	reflecting in certain light spectrums from scales on the wings.
</p>  

<p>
	Morpho butterflies are forest dwellers but will venture into 
	sunny clearings to warm themselves. The entire life cycle of 
	the Morpho butterfly, from egg to death, is approximately 137 
	days. The adults live for about a month. They have few predators 
	as the adults are poisonous due to the feeding caterpillar 
	sequestering poisonous compounds.
