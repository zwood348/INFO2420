<h1>Extreme Honeymoons Tributes</h1>

<hr>

<p>
I'm Brian Jones.<br>
My wife Kitty and I were just married last winter.<br>
We wanted a memorable honeymoon experience, and so we looked into the excursions offered by Extreme Honeymoons.<br>
Something I always wanted to do was bow hunt.<br>
We were surprised that a cougar hunt was available the week just after we were to be married.<br>
It was great to have all the details of this trip taken care of for us by professionals who knew just what was needed.<br>
The owners even provided some archery instruction for both of us before the trip began.<br>
<br>
We met our hunt leader, Tom Henry, the first day of our trip. He runs a team of 4 hound dogs when he hunts cougars. The hunt began just after a light snow, so the big cats could be tracked.<br>
We saw three cougars that day, but were not able to get any clean shots. It was a tiring, exciting, beautiful weekend. Thanks so much, Extreme Honeymoons, for a memorable honeymoon experience.<br>
We are sending a couple of snapshots of our great weekend.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the memories,<br>
Brian and Kitty Jones

We just wanted to thank you folks at Extreme Honeymoons for a rip-roaring time during our honeymoon trip.<br>
I had always wanted to try heliskiing, and my honeymoon seemed as good a time to go for it.<br>
Both my wife Mary and I are experienced downhill skiers, but we had never tried extreme skiing or snowboarding before.<br>
It was wonderful to be able to rely on your expert team of pilots and guides to make this dream come true.<br>
We were lucky to have new powder snow the weekend we had booked the trip.<br>
Extreme Honeymoons even captured these great photos of our trip.<br>
Kings Peak is the tallest peak in the state of Utah, and it was really amazing that we can now say that we skied it.<br>
We were able to make 6 runs a day and each one was an adventure.<br>
I was worried about our ski and snowboarding equipment, but it was double checked by our guide and we had no problems.<br>
We will tell all our friends about this great way to spend a honeymoon.<br>
Thanks for handling the details, so we could enjoy this experience together.<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>
David and Mary Farnsworth

Who would have thought you could spend your honeymoon having the adventure of your life.<br>
I wanted to give my new wife, Louise, an exciting honeymoon. I have been riding mountain bikes for about 5 years.<br>
Both Louise and I are in fairly good shape, so the mountain biking trip over the red rock of Moab was the trip we wanted for ourselves.<br>
The bed and breakfast inn we stayed in down in Moab was great. We had an early breakfast and then were transferred along with our equipment and a light lunch to the trail head.<br>
We were provided with a map and GPS receiver and we were off.<br>
The day was hot, about 90 degrees, but we had plenty of water and we never felt stressed.<br>
Every time we look at our photos from that weekend, we remember the wonderful time we had.<br>
The cost was sure reasonable and we could have never done this without your help.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the time of our lives,<br>
Peter and Polly Renquist
